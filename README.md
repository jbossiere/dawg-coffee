# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> http://students.washington.edu/jgb93/info343/dawg-coffee/

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> Kind of.  I asked a couple questions to Katrina Ezis and Natasha Dietzler (who is in the section taught by the other teacher), but their responses didn't actually help me because I either figured it out before they replied, or they didn't know the answer.

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> No, unfortunately.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> Almost 12, but mostly because I was stuck on a few details that I just absolutely couldn't figure out.
**Edit 10/13 Logged another 2 hours to complete the assignment

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> Many problems, actually, but none that I can actually think of a way of warning future students about.  I'd just really stress getting it started earlier because I left it for the last minute - due to busy schedule in combination with a little procrastination, and I really struggled because I didn't have time to get help.  But, I do also think making the assignment due on Wednesday (a week after the first assignment) would also be fair.  Because there were no scheduled office hours from the assignment start date until the due date, if the student doesn't' schedule an appointment with either the professor or the TA, there would be no way to get one-on-one help before the assignment is due - besides email, but that can be a bit difficult at times.
**Edit 10/13 With the due date extension, I had the opportunity to go to office hours, and I had the chance to formulate questions that I asked Andrew about.  The answers I got to these questions were great and in the end, made completing the challenge to my satisfaction much simpler and much more enjoyable! Thank you! The extension helped tremendously.
